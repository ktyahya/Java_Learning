# HackerRank Java Practice 🚀

This repository contains all my daily Java practice solutions from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/ktyahya792/hackos). I'm learning Java from the basics, solving problems consistently, and organizing them by topic for easy reference.

> 📌 **Goal:** Build a strong Java foundation, improve problem-solving skills, and create a professional portfolio to showcase to recruiters and interviewers.

Each day I solve one or more Java problems from HackerRank and update the repository. Solutions include:
